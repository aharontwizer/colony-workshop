# Module 4

### You are the DevOps engineer and would like to use the latest AWS DocumentDB service instead of MongoDB for your promotion application. ​

### You will make a simple change to your blueprint to include a predefined Terraform module, and Voila! ​

### Finally, you will publish your blueprint and test your new configuration in a sandbox.
