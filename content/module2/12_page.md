You've realized that you need more time to work on your promotion manager application functional testing and your sandbox is about to expire! Thankfully with CloudShell Colony this will not be a problem: you can easily extend the duration for another hour, if your user policy allows you. 
 
Before the sandbox expires extend the default time from 2 hrs to 3hrs.

By default, it will be automatically deprovisioned once the specified time has expired, or you can end the sandbox from the UI.
