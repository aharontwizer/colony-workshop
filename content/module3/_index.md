# Module 3

### You are a DevOps engineer and will use Jenkins to deploy the promotion manager application environment from the blueprint catalog using the Colony REST API. 
Gourmet Inc wants to leverage from existing CI tools to automatically release new versions of the promotion manager application.
In this module, you will use Colony to first deploy and configure the Jenkins CI platform. 
Then, you will run a Jenkins job that will automatically deploy the latest version of the promotion app, retrieve the URL of the deployed app, run your test, and terminate the environment using the Colony REST API.
